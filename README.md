## Overview

AI-Skills coordinates multiple AI coding agents (Codex, Claude, Gemini/Agy, OpenCode) through a multi-stage, two-layer orchestration runtime. It takes GitHub issues from "ready" to "merged PR" without human intervention — routing each task to the best agent/model based on complexity, managing parallel execution in isolated git worktrees, recovering worker artifacts and merge conflicts automatically, and opening a single final pull request. GitHub Copilot metadata is retained only for fail-fast blocking while the Copilot plan is exhausted.

The system runs end-to-end:
1. Analyze requirements and discover dependencies
2. Generate a PRD and break it into implementation issues
3. Route each issue to the right agent/model using real-time subscription-debt balancing
4. Execute in parallel with isolated worktrees, review loops, artifact/stall recovery, and automatic merge recovery
5. Open a single PR with issue links, model usage summaries, and verification results

## Requirements

- **Git** — orchestration runs in isolated `git worktree`s (works without git too; it just skips commit-history context)
- **Python 3** — the routing, state, artifact, and PR-body helpers are Python scripts
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**, authenticated — for issue intake, comments, and the final PR (optional; falls back to local files when unavailable)
- **At least one enabled supported coding agent** — Codex, Claude Code, Gemini/Antigravity, Agy, or OpenCode. GitHub Copilot is registry-disabled while the Copilot plan is exhausted.

## Installation

**macOS / Linux / Git Bash:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chanakya-net/Maestro-AI/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chanakya-net/Maestro-AI/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer detects which coding agents you have (Codex, Claude, Gemini, Agy, OpenCode; Copilot metadata remains blocked) and installs skills + shared assets for each. Assets go to `~/.ai-skill-collections/assets` (macOS/Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\.ai-skill-collections\assets` (Windows).

**Per-agent install (without shared assets):**

```bash
claude plugin install github:chanakya-net/Maestro-AI              # Claude Code
gemini extensions install github.com/chanakya-net/Maestro-AI       # Gemini CLI
npx -y skills add chanakya-net/Maestro-AI -a codex                # Codex
npx -y skills add chanakya-net/Maestro-AI -a github-copilot        # GitHub Copilot skill target; runtime use remains blocked while exhausted
npx -y skills add chanakya-net/Maestro-AI -a antigravity           # Antigravity
```

Override the asset destination or the git ref the installer pulls from:

```bash
ASSETS_DEST="$HOME/.my-ai-assets" ASSETS_REF=main bash install.sh
```

## Quick Start

The skills run inside your coding agent — invoke them by slash command (e.g. `/break-req` in Claude Code) or in plain language. A full run from idea to merged PR chains four skills:

```text
break-req  →  create-git-issue  →  run-with-it
   ▲                                    │
 (idea)                          (single final PR)
```

1. **Discover requirements** — `break-req` interviews you one question at a time and captures constraints.
2. **Create issues** — `create-git-issue` turns those decisions into a PRD and publishes dependency-aware `ready-for-agent` issues to GitHub.
3. **Run it** — `run-with-it` fetches every `ready-for-agent` issue, plans a topological order, and executes them in a rolling pool, opening one final PR when everything reaches a terminal state.

If you already have labeled issues, skip straight to `run-with-it`. Tune the run with environment variables — for example, sequential execution with a custom label:

```bash
PARALLEL_JOBS=1 ISSUE_LABEL=ready-for-agent  # then invoke run-with-it
```

## What's New

Recent `run-with-it` updates focus on keeping long multi-agent runs observable and recoverable:

- **Live stage board** — the pool runner emits `STATUS|type=run-board|board=...` whenever issue stages change. You can print the same read-only view with `python3 assets/run-with-it-state.py status-board --state-file .run-with-it/main-state.json` or add `--oneline`.
- **Artifact and stall recovery** — dispatchers now synthesize missing implementation/modification result artifacts from git ground truth, salvage stalled workers that left committed or dirty work behind, and escalate exhausted artifact failures to the Artifact Recovery Worker.
- **Availability-aware routing** — auth, quota, and unsupported-model failures are emitted as `STATUS|type=agent-unavailable`, excluded from subsequent routing, and do not consume the capability fallback budget.
- **Safer state repair** — `run-with-it-state.py requeue` quarantines stale terminal artifacts before a retry, and dependents blocked only by a newly completed issue are reset automatically.
- **Safer branch refs** — issue branches use the flat `${RUN_FEATURE_BRANCH}-issue-<n>` form instead of nesting under the shared branch, avoiding Git ref path conflicts.
- **Windows parity** — PowerShell runners now mirror the Bash dispatcher behavior for artifact synthesis, failure classification, and agent-unavailable reporting.

## Uninstall

```bash
# macOS / Linux / Git Bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chanakya-net/Maestro-AI/main/uninstall.sh | bash

# Windows PowerShell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chanakya-net/Maestro-AI/main/uninstall.ps1 | iex
```

Preview before removing: use `--dry-run` (bash) or `-DryRun` (PowerShell).

## Skills

Each skill is a standalone `SKILL.md` file that AI coding agents load as specialized instructions.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `break-req` | Interviews you one question at a time to discover requirements, map dependencies, and capture technical constraints before planning. |
| `create-git-issue` | Turns resolved requirements into a PRD and publishes dependency-aware tracer-bullet implementation issues to GitHub. |
| `run-with-it` | Two-layer orchestration runtime — schedules ready issues with topological ordering, routes work to the best agent/model, runs them in parallel pools with isolated worktrees, and recovers from merge conflicts automatically. |
| `tdd-implementation` | Strict red-green-refactor loop — one test at a time, never cuts horizontal slices, verifies everything before committing. |
| `help-me-debug` | Deep diagnosis workflow that produces both a human-readable root-cause report and a deterministic LLM-ready context file for handoff. |
| `save-tokens` | Ultra-compressed narration mode — drops articles, filler, and pleasantries while keeping code and technical terms exact. |

## Runtime Assets

The `assets/` directory contains the shared prompts, scripts, and configuration that power `run-with-it`.

### Runner & Dispatcher

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `run-agent.sh` / `run-agent.ps1` | Cross-agent CLI runner — wraps Codex, Claude, Agy, and OpenCode behind a unified interface with status bus, telemetry, GUI-safe permission downgrading, and structured agent-unavailable reporting; `github-copilot`/`copilot` fails fast while disabled. |
| `run-with-it-dispatch.sh` / `run-with-it-dispatch.ps1` | Worker dispatcher — spawns background agent sessions via `run-agent`, monitors liveness, detects stalls, classifies failures as infrastructure vs. capability, and recovers missing result artifacts from git state. |
| `run-with-it-pool.sh` / `run-with-it-pool.ps1` | Rolling-pool supervisor — fills available parallel slots with ready issues, spawns Sub-Coordinators, emits the live run-board, detects merge/sub-coordinator failures, and triggers recovery. |
| `run-with-it-watch.sh` / `run-with-it-watch.ps1` | Bounded status watcher — each call prints status lines appended since the previous call and exits within its watch window; reports `pool-empty`, `running`, or `pool-dead` so the Main Coordinator stays attached without long blocking calls. |
| `run-with-it-stop.sh` / `run-with-it-stop.ps1` | Identity-checked run shutdown — terminates and verifies complete process groups/trees for every recorded pool, dispatcher, and runner PID; used by confirmed `discard`. |

### Prompts (agent instructions)

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `sub-coordinator-prompt.md` | Full Sub-Coordinator instructions — worktree bootstrap, complexity scoring, routing, implementation, review, modify loop, and merge back to shared branch. |
| `prompt.md` | Implementation worker — writes code, commits to issue worktree, produces result artifact JSON with verification evidence. |
| `review-prompt.md` | Review worker — read-only diff analysis producing JSON verdict with file/line/severity/fix comments. |
| `modifier-prompt.md` | Modify worker — addresses reviewer comments, re-verifies, commits fixes on the issue branch. |
| `artifact-recovery-prompt.md` | Artifact Recovery Worker — inspects dirty impl/modify work after artifact retry exhaustion, verifies or commits salvage, and writes a synthesized-result/requeue/blocked decision. |
| `complexity-prompt.md` | Complexity scoring agent — scores issues on 9 dimensions (dependency risk, architecture risk, blast radius, etc.) for routing decisions. |
| `merge-recovery-prompt.md` | Merge Recovery Coordinator — resolves conflicts when an issue branch can't merge into the shared feature branch. |
| `coordinator-rules.md` | Compact Sub-Coordinator rules re-read before every major phase for compaction survival. |
| `main-orchestrator-rules.md` | Compact Main Orchestrator rules re-read every loop iteration after context compression. |

### Routing & State

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `agent-registry.json` | Agent catalog — detection commands, invocation templates, 26-model catalog with complexity weights, routing rules, and subscription distribution targets. |
| `run-with-it-router.py` | Deterministic model router — selects agent/model pairs using usage-debt minimization across usable providers with role-specific and complexity-band-specific targets (default: Codex 60%, Claude 35%, Agy 5%; GitHub Copilot is registry-disabled while the plan is exhausted). |
| `run-with-it-state.py` | State mutation helper — atomic JSON reads/writes for issue readiness, dependency resolution, context file generation, status-board rendering, requeue repair, auto-unblocking, and merge recovery transitions. |
| `run-with-it-artifacts.py` | Artifact validator — validates worker result JSONs, classifies artifact failures, accepts verified no-ops, and safely synthesizes missing artifacts from git commits, log output, or canonical retry data. |
| `run-with-it-github-update.py` | GitHub terminal updater — posts issue comments with status/verification/token summaries and closes completed issues via `gh` CLI. |
| `run-with-it-pr-body.py` | Final PR body renderer — generates markdown with closed issue links, per-issue model usage tables, and verification summaries. |
| `worker-watch.sh` / `worker-watch.ps1` | Liveness watcher — checks PID existence, done sentinel presence, and log tail changes for background workers. |

## Runtime Architecture

`run-with-it` uses a multi-stage architecture designed to survive LLM context compression over multi-hour runs.

### Stage 1: Planning

The Main Orchestrator fetches all issues labeled `ready-for-agent` from GitHub (or local files), parses `## Blocked by` sections to build a dependency graph, detects cycles, and computes a topological execution order. It preserves each issue's `parallel_safe` and normalized `ownership_scope` metadata, creates one shared run feature branch that will eventually hold all merged work, and writes the execution plan and initial state to `.run-with-it/main-state.json`.

### Stage 2: Execution (Rolling Pool)

The pool runner maintains up to `PARALLEL_JOBS` (default 4) concurrent Sub-Coordinators. Each Sub-Coordinator gets exactly one issue and follows this lifecycle:

1. **Worktree bootstrap** — Fetches the shared branch and creates an isolated issue branch/worktree from `origin/$RUN_FEATURE_BRANCH` when available, with an explicit local fallback. The selected `issue_base_sha` and source are persisted. Issue branches use `${RUN_FEATURE_BRANCH}-issue-<n>` so Git refs stay flat.
2. **Complexity scoring** — Spawns a complexity agent to score the issue on 9 dimensions
3. **Model routing** — `run-with-it-router.py` selects the best agent/model pair based on complexity band, role-specific usage targets, and current subscription debt
4. **Implementation** — Worker agent writes code in the issue worktree, commits, and produces a result JSON with verification evidence
5. **Review** — Review worker analyzes the diff and produces a verdict (approve/request-changes)
6. **Modify** (if needed) — Modify worker addresses reviewer comments and re-verifies. Up to `MAX_ITERATIONS` review/modify cycles (default 20).
7. **Merge** — Sub-Coordinator acquires the merge lock, merges in a fresh throwaway worktree, verifies, and pushes so a conflict cannot dirty the shared checkout

After each Sub-Coordinator completes, the pool immediately fills the freed slot with the next compatible ready issue. `parallel_safe=false` or missing concurrency metadata runs exclusively; explicitly safe issues share the pool only when ownership scopes are non-overlapping. It also emits a compact run-board whenever stages change, for example `#12 impl(cyc1) | #13 blocked:12 | #14 done`. The Main Orchestrator reads only compact report JSONs — never raw logs — keeping its context window bounded regardless of run duration.

### Stage 3: Worker Recovery

Worker completion is artifact-driven: a role is complete only when the done sentinel and required JSON artifacts are valid and implementation/modification verification passed. Result commits are canonicalized before comparison, so unique abbreviated SHAs are accepted safely. If a worker exits after committing work but before writing its artifact, the dispatcher preserves it as `artifact-recovery-required`; unverified synthesized work never advances as normal success. Wrapper-owned heartbeats keep non-streaming CLIs alive, while a separate hard limit bounds truly stuck workers.

Failures are classified as:

- `infrastructure` — account/auth, quota, or unsupported-model availability failures. The failed route is excluded and retried without consuming `MAX_AGENT_FALLBACKS`.
- `capability` — a runner started but could not produce a valid artifact. These attempts consume the fallback budget.

When implementation or modification artifact retries are exhausted, the Artifact Recovery Worker inspects the issue worktree, runs verification, commits salvage when safe, and returns `synthesized-result`, `requeue`, or `blocked`.

### Stage 4: Merge Recovery

When an issue branch conflicts with the shared feature branch, the Sub-Coordinator reports `outcome=merge_failed`. The pool runner transitions the issue to `merge_recovery` status and spawns a Merge Recovery Coordinator — a specialized agent that:

- Acquires the exclusive merge lock
- Has holistic access to both the shared branch and the failed issue branch
- Resolves conflicts, runs verification, commits, and pushes
- Writes a compact recovery report

Issues waiting on a `merge_recovery` issue remain blocked until recovery succeeds. Unrelated issues continue running in parallel.

### Stage 5: Final PR

When all issues reach a terminal state (completed, failed, or blocked), the Main Orchestrator creates a single pull request from the shared feature branch. The PR body includes:

- Processed issue list with statuses
- Per-issue model usage table (which agent/model ran each role and cycle)
- Verification summaries
- Links to closed GitHub issues

### Compaction Survival

The system is built to survive LLM context compression — the Main Orchestrator's session may be compressed to a fraction of its original size after long runs. Key design decisions:

- All state lives in `.run-with-it/main-state.json`, re-read before every loop iteration
- Compact rules files (`coordinator-rules.md`, `main-orchestrator-rules.md`) are re-read after compression
- The Main Orchestrator never loads worker logs — only compact JSON reports
- Sub-Coordinators never touch GitHub state — only the pool runner does
- Worker completion requires both done sentinels and result artifacts; PID liveness alone is diagnostic
- The live status bus is terminal-visible only: `.run-with-it/status/current.txt` is overwritten with the latest status, while `.run-with-it/status/events.log` is append-only

## Routing Controls

Override routing behavior with environment variables:

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `FORCED_AGENT` | Canonical explicit child-worker agent override (codex, claude, agy). `github-copilot`/`copilot` fails fast while the Copilot plan is exhausted. |
| `FORCED_MODEL` | Canonical explicit child-worker model override |
| `AGENT` | Deprecated compatibility alias: normalize only an explicitly user-supplied value to `FORCED_AGENT`; never read ambient runtime values. |
| `MODEL` | Deprecated compatibility alias: normalize only an explicitly user-supplied value to `FORCED_MODEL`; never read ambient runtime values. |
| `AGENT_ALLOWLIST` | Comma-separated agent slugs to permit |
| `AGENT_DENYLIST` | Comma-separated agent slugs to block |
| `RUN_WITH_IT_MODEL_DENYLIST` | Comma-separated models or `agent:model` routes to exclude after availability failures |
| `RUN_WITH_IT_MODEL_AVAILABILITY_FILE` | Optional persisted route-availability file. A missing file is empty state; a present malformed file is an error. |
| `COMPLEXITY_LEVEL` | Force complexity band (quite-easy through holy-fuck) |
| `COMPLEXITY_SCORE` | Force a numeric complexity score |
| `AGENT_REGISTRY_FILE` | Override the path to `agent-registry.json` |

### Automatic routing matrix

The router calculates a base complexity band, applies the role adjustment, and
then limits every non-complexity automatic route to this exact set:

| Effective band | Automatic models |
|---|---|
| quite-easy / easy | GPT-5.4, Codex Spark, GPT-5.6 Luna, Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Haiku 4.5, eligible Gemini models exposed by Agy |
| medium | GPT-5.6 Terra, Codex Spark, Claude Sonnet 5 |
| medium-hard | GPT-5.5, GPT-5.6 Sol, Claude Opus 5 |
| complex | GPT-5.6 Sol, Claude Opus 5 |
| holy-fuck | GPT-5.6 Sol, Claude Opus 5, Claude Fable 5 |

Complexity scoring keeps its independent lightweight routing. Review applies a
one-band increase and planning applies a two-band increase before this matrix.
Explicit forced-model overrides may select outside the automatic matrix but
still must pass agent compatibility and availability checks.

Effort is also based on the effective band: Sol uses `high` at medium-hard and
`xhigh` at complex/holy-fuck; Sonnet 5 uses `low`, `medium`, and `medium` from
quite-easy through medium; Opus 5 uses `high` at medium-hard, `xhigh` at
complex, and `max` at holy-fuck; Fable 5 uses `max` at holy-fuck. The runner
translates these to Codex `model_reasoning_effort` or
Claude Code `--effort`.

### Orchestration knobs

Control how `run-with-it` schedules and intakes work:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `PARALLEL_JOBS` | `4` | Rolling pool size — freed slots fill immediately. Set to `1` for sequential execution. |
| `ISSUE_LABEL` | `ready-for-agent` | Label filter for issue intake |
| `ISSUE_STATE` | `open` | Issue state filter |
| `ISSUE_LIMIT` | `1000` | Maximum number of matching issues to fetch |
| `SUB_COORD_AGENT` | `codex` | Agent used to run Sub-Coordinators |
| `SUB_COORD_MODEL` | `gpt-5.6-sol` | Model used to run Sub-Coordinators |
| `SUB_COORD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `3600` | Seconds before a non-completing Sub-Coordinator raises a stall alert |
| `STATUS_POLL_SECONDS` | `10` | Pool status polling cadence |
| `MAX_AGENT_FALLBACKS` | `2` | Capability-failure retry budget per worker role |
| `RUN_WITH_IT_AUTO_FAIL_STALLED_ROLES` | `complexity,impl,modify` | Worker roles the dispatcher may terminate after stall detection |
| `RUN_WITH_IT_WORKER_QUIET_SECONDS` | `120` | Seconds of worker silence before `quiet` status |
| `RUN_WITH_IT_WORKER_STALL_SECONDS` | platform default | Seconds of worker silence before `stalled` status |
| `RUN_WITH_IT_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS` | `30` | Runner-owned heartbeat cadence, independent of model stdout |
| `RUN_WITH_IT_WORKER_HARD_LIMIT_SECONDS` | `7200` | Hard elapsed worker bound; `0` disables it |

The pool dispatcher's `--agent` and `--model` values, including the default Sol
model, configure only each Sub-Coordinator process. They never become
child-worker routing overrides; use explicit `FORCED_AGENT` and `FORCED_MODEL`
for that policy.

For deprecated compatibility, the Main Orchestrator normalizes `AGENT` or
`MODEL` only when that alias is explicitly named in the user's request. A
matching canonical `FORCED_*` request takes precedence. Ambient `AGENT` and
`MODEL` are never inspected for aliases and are discarded at the dispatcher
boundary, so they cannot affect Sub-Coordinator routing.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
for test_file in tests/*.test.sh; do bash "$test_file"; done

# Focused
bash tests/run-agent.test.sh
bash tests/run-with-it-dispatch.test.sh
bash tests/run-with-it-pool.test.sh
bash tests/run-with-it-routing.test.sh
```

The suite is contract-heavy — verifying exact string presence in output, skill boundaries, routing language, status events, done sentinels, artifact synthesis, failure classification, PowerShell parity, and orchestration state transitions.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing shared assets
Re-run the installer: `bash install.sh` or `.\install.ps1`

### Manual asset repair (Unix)

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.ai-skill-collections/assets"
for f in assets/*; do cp "$f" "$HOME/.ai-skill-collections/assets/"; done
chmod +x "$HOME/.ai-skill-collections/assets/"*.sh "$HOME/.ai-skill-collections/assets/"*.py
```

### No git repo
`run-with-it` works without git — it skips commit-history context and continues with issue/local context.

## Adding a Skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML front matter (`name`, `description`)
2. Add supporting files under `assets/` if needed
3. Add or update contract tests under `tests/`
4. Re-run relevant tests before publishing
