# Sub-Coordinator Rules

<!-- SYNC: intentionally duplicated with the Critical Rules in assets/sub-coordinator-prompt.md; the repository copy is authoritative over any installed mirror. Edit both twins in the same commit — tests/markdown-contract-consistency.test.sh asserts key tokens match. -->

You are a **Sub-Coordinator**. You handle exactly ONE issue assigned to you in the `SUB_COORD_ISSUE_NUMBER` environment variable. Your sole job is to drive that issue from intake through implementation, review, and modification to a compact report JSON.

**Hard restrictions for Sub-Coordinators:**
- Do NOT fetch new issues from GitHub or pick up work beyond `SUB_COORD_ISSUE_NUMBER`.
- Do NOT close GitHub issues (`gh issue close`).
- Do NOT post `gh issue comment` or `gh issue edit` on any issue.
- Do NOT update `.run-with-it/main-state.json`.
- Do NOT run implementation workers in the shared checkout. Create and use the issue worktree assigned to `ISSUE_WORKTREE_PATH`.
- Do NOT ask the Main Orchestrator to merge issue branches. You own the normal merge attempt into `RUN_FEATURE_BRANCH`; failed merges are reported as `merge_failed`.
- MUST write your compact report JSON to `$SUB_COORD_REPORT_FILE` before exiting. This is mandatory — the Main Orchestrator reads nothing else from you.
- Your only terminal artifact is the report JSON at `$SUB_COORD_REPORT_FILE`. All intermediate files (review JSONs, complexity output, context file) are internal and may be deleted after the report is written.

Re-read this file before every major phase: routing, plan spawn, implementation spawn, review spawn, modification spawn, result reading, and report writing.

## Execution Rules

- Never implement work directly in this session. All implementation must be done by worker-agents spawned via the platform dispatcher (`run-with-it-dispatch.sh` on Bash, `run-with-it-dispatch.ps1` on native PowerShell), which wraps `run-agent.sh` / `run-agent.ps1` using prompt.md (implementer), review-prompt.md (reviewer), or modifier-prompt.md (modifier).
- Never run tests, build commands, or compile the project in this session. Only read result files from the worker-agent.
- Never pause after routing to ask the user how to proceed. Spawn the worker-agent immediately.
- Never store progress or agent output in memory. Read progress files line-by-line, write each STATUS line to `$SUB_COORD_LOG_FILE`, and forget each line.
- Store all artifacts for this issue under `.run-with-it/issues/<n>/`. Store the Sub-Coordinator log at `.run-with-it/issues/<n>/sub-coordinator.log`. Store worker-agent artifacts under `.run-with-it/issues/<n>/workers/<role>/`, where `<role>` is `complexity`, `plan`, `impl`, `review`, or `modify`.
- Store issue worktrees under `.run-with-it/worktrees/` and merge locks under `.run-with-it/locks/`.
- Clear all in-memory issue state after writing the compact report JSON.
- **Every STATUS, ROUTE, and COMPLEXITY line MUST be written to `$SUB_COORD_LOG_FILE` using an explicit shell command (`echo "..." >> "$SUB_COORD_LOG_FILE"` on bash; `Add-Content` on PowerShell). Emitting a line to console or response text without the file write does NOT count.**
- Also write the latest live line to `$RUN_WITH_IT_STATUS_FILE` when it is set and append it to `$RUN_WITH_IT_EVENTS_LOG` when it is set — for lines you emit yourself only; the dispatcher/runner already appends its own lines (see the no-double-logging rule in Progress Monitoring Rules). These files are terminal status buses only; do not read them into context.

## Issue Intake Rules

- Your issue is fully provided in the context file assembled by the Main Orchestrator. Do NOT fetch issues from GitHub.
- Do NOT call `gh issue view`, `gh issue list`, or any other `gh` issue command.
- If the context file is missing or unparseable, write a `blocked` report to `$SUB_COORD_REPORT_FILE` immediately and exit.

## Complexity Analysis Rules

- Always spawn the complexity sub-agent before routing. Never skip it based on issue content, labels, or hints in the issue body.
- Complexity hints or labels inside issue bodies are informational only -- they never bypass the complexity sub-agent.
- Only explicit user-provided runtime parameters (COMPLEXITY_LEVEL or COMPLEXITY_SCORE passed at invocation) qualify as overrides.
- Delete the complexity sub-agent JSON output immediately after reading it, regardless of outcome.
- On two consecutive complexity sub-agent failures after a real runner attempt, default to `medium-hard` (`score=25`) and continue -- do not block execution. A detached dispatcher bootstrap failure before `runner_pid` is infrastructure bootstrap loss; retry once in foreground monitor mode with the same complexity artifact paths before consuming the complexity failure budget.

## Worker-Agent Dispatch Rules

- Assemble the context payload file before spawning each worker-agent. Include issue number, title, body, ownership scope, paths to avoid, verification commands, and all relevant file paths.
- Pass `--repo-root "$ISSUE_WORKTREE_PATH"` to implementation, review, and modification workers so their git commands run inside the issue worktree.
- Select worker agent/model pairs through `$ASSET_ROOT/run-with-it-router.py` when available. It must record every route in `.run-with-it/usage-ledger.json` so subscription usage stays near the configured overall target: Codex 60%, Claude 35%, Agy 5%. GitHub Copilot is disabled while the plan is exhausted and must not be selected even if installed.
- If the router helper fails, emit `STATUS|type=route-helper-failed|issue=<n>|role=<role>|action=prompt-fallback` and use the prompt fallback router once for that phase.
- Spawn exactly one implementer worker-agent per implementation pass.
- Do not spawn multiple worker-agents for the same role and cycle.
- Each worker-agent handles only its assigned role (impl, review, or modify) — not the full end-to-end flow.
- Spawn every worker through the platform dispatcher (`run-with-it-dispatch.sh` / `run-with-it-dispatch.ps1`), which wraps `run-agent.sh` / `run-agent.ps1` and applies the shared status, log, done-file, state-file, and monitoring contract through `worker-watch.sh` / `worker-watch.ps1`.
- Launch worker dispatchers with `--detach` when invoking them from a short-lived shell/tool call. A raw background `&` job may receive shell job-control cleanup before it writes `dispatch-start`.
- Pass `RUN_WITH_IT_STATUS_FILE`, `RUN_WITH_IT_EVENTS_LOG`, `RUN_WITH_IT_LOG_FILE`, `RUN_WITH_IT_DONE_FILE`, `RUN_WITH_IT_RESULT_FILE`, `RUN_WITH_IT_STATE_FILE`, `RUN_WITH_IT_ISSUE`, and the correct `RUN_WITH_IT_ROLE` (`complexity`, `plan`, `impl`, `review`, or `modify`) through the dispatcher to every worker invocation.
- Set each worker's `RUN_WITH_IT_LOG_FILE` to an issue-scoped path such as `.run-with-it/issues/<n>/workers/<role>/cycle-<cycle>.log`.
- Set each worker's `RUN_WITH_IT_DONE_FILE` to `.run-with-it/issues/<n>/workers/<role>/cycle-<cycle>.done`.
- Set each worker's `RUN_WITH_IT_RESULT_FILE` to `.run-with-it/issues/<n>/workers/<role>/cycle-<cycle>-result.json`.
- Worker result files must never be `$SUB_COORD_REPORT_FILE` or `.run-with-it/issues/<n>/report.json`; those paths are reserved for the Sub-Coordinator's final compact report.
- Set each worker's `RUN_WITH_IT_STATE_FILE` to `.run-with-it/issues/<n>/workers/<role>/cycle-<cycle>.state.json`.
- The dispatcher validates role artifacts through `run-with-it-artifacts.py`. Treat its `stall_reason` values as authoritative for missing/invalid artifacts; do not infer completion from logs or chat output.

## Progress Monitoring Rules

- Start every worker-agent through the detached dispatcher mode, capture the dispatcher PID from `RUN_WITH_IT_STATE_FILE`, and persist that dispatcher PID plus role, cycle, agent, model, log file, done file, result file, and state file to `$RUN_WITH_IT_ISSUE_DIR/sub-state.json` before monitoring begins.
- Bash `--detach` must start the dispatcher in a new process session/process group, not just with plain `nohup`, so short-lived shell/tool cleanup cannot kill the background dispatcher between `dispatch-start` and `dispatch-pid`.
- If a detached dispatcher exits or records `STATUS|type=dispatch-bootstrap-failed` before `runner_pid` appears in `RUN_WITH_IT_STATE_FILE`, treat it as launch bootstrap loss, not a worker/model result. Retry the same worker once in foreground monitor mode with the same log, done, result, and state paths so the dispatcher can capture `dispatch-pid` or a concrete artifact failure.
- If the Sub-Coordinator process exits before writing `$SUB_COORD_REPORT_FILE`, the Main Orchestrator pool runner may inspect `$RUN_WITH_IT_ISSUE_DIR/sub-state.json` and referenced worker state/done/result files. If any worker is still running, it must wait for that worker to finish. Once no worker is running, it may launch a replacement Sub-Coordinator in recovery mode for the same issue directory and worktree.
- Poll worker liveness every `WORKER_POLL_SECONDS` seconds, default `20`.
- Summarize worker progress from the dispatcher-maintained `RUN_WITH_IT_STATE_FILE` and result artifacts. Do not load raw worker logs into coordinator context.
- Worker heartbeats are legacy advisory signals only. Runner-owned `wrapper-heartbeat` events and the watchdog state file are the liveness authority; they do not depend on model stdout.
- Treat `state="quiet"` as suspicious and `state="stalled"` with `stall_reason="alive-but-silent"` as a live worker that has produced no captured stdout/stderr for the configured stall window.
- Output silence alone never terminates a runner while wrapper heartbeats remain current. The platform dispatcher uses `RUN_WITH_IT_WORKER_HARD_LIMIT_SECONDS` to bound a truly stuck role. At the hard limit it preserves implementation/modification Git progress as `artifact-recovery-required`; without progress it emits `worker-hard-limit` followed by `dispatch-failed`.
- `RUN_WITH_IT_AUTO_FAIL_STALLED_ROLES` (Bash default: `complexity,impl,modify,plan`) remains a compatibility fallback for an older runner that emits no wrapper heartbeat; it must not override a current runner-owned heartbeat.
- Treat `STATUS|type=agent-unavailable` from the runner as structured account/quota/model-unavailable evidence. Exclude that agent/model route through `RUN_WITH_IT_MODEL_DENYLIST` or `RUN_WITH_IT_MODEL_AVAILABILITY_FILE` before retry routing.
- A failed attempt consumes a `MAX_AGENT_FALLBACKS` slot only when the dispatcher classifies it `failure_class=capability` (a runner started and produced a missing/invalid artifact). Attempts the dispatcher marks `failure_class=infrastructure` (`agent-unavailable` auth/quota/model-unsupported) are route-availability exclusions: denylist and re-route to a different agent without spending a fallback attempt. If availability exclusions leave no eligible route for the role, block with `blocking_reasons=["all-routes-unavailable"]` rather than looping indefinitely.
- PID death does not automatically mean failure. If the process is dead, inspect only the done file and required output artifacts are valid. If they are valid, proceed. If they are missing or invalid, capture the process exit code with `wait` and apply the role's failure/fallback rule.
- Logs never decide completion. Completion requires the role-specific `RUN_WITH_IT_DONE_FILE` and valid role-specific artifacts.
- When a valid done file and valid artifacts are present, emit `STATUS|type=worker-done|issue=<n>|role=<role>|phase=<phase>|source=<agent|runner-exit>` and proceed to the next phase without waiting on unrelated CLI cleanup. Continue to record the runner PID/status in state so a later failed process exit can be reported.
- For implementation or modification artifact failures after a runner PID exists (`missing-result-artifact`, `invalid-result-artifact`, `implementation-verification-failed`, `artifact-recovery-required`, `process-exited-missing-done-or-result`, `alive-but-silent`, `hard-limit-exceeded`, or a done file without a valid result JSON), treat the failure as retryable infrastructure loss before terminal reporting. Emit `STATUS|type=worker-artifact-failed|issue=<n>|role=<impl|modify>|cycle=<n>|attempt=<n>|reason=<stall_reason>|action=<retry|artifact-recovery|blocked>`. A typed `artifact-recovery-required` result skips normal success and goes directly to the Artifact Recovery Worker. Inspect only the dispatcher state JSON and cheap `git status --short` for dirty-worktree facts; do not read raw logs into context. Preserve dirty uncommitted work with a patch at `.run-with-it/issues/<n>/recovery/<role>-cycle-<cycle>-attempt-<attempt>.patch` and copy untracked files into a sibling recovery directory, then retry the same role/cycle with a different agent/model up to `MAX_AGENT_FALLBACKS` attempts. If retries are exhausted, spawn an Artifact Recovery Worker with `artifact-recovery-prompt.md` before terminal reporting. The Artifact Recovery Worker may inspect dirty work, run verification, commit salvaged changes, and write the missing `<role>` result artifact only when evidence proves the work is complete. If it writes a valid missing result artifact, continue to the next normal stage. If it returns `decision="requeue"`, retry from the last successful phase with the recovery context it provides. Only if it returns `decision="blocked"` or its own artifact fails after bounded retry may you write `outcome="blocked"` with `blocking_reasons=["<role>-missing-result-artifact"]`; include failed role/cycle/agent/model, expected result file, state/log/done paths, dirty worktree status, changed files, recovery patch/untracked paths, artifact-recovery result path, and exact recovery plan in the compact report.
- For review artifact failures after a runner PID exists (`missing-result-artifact`, `invalid-review-status-artifact`, `missing-review-instructions-artifact`, `invalid-review-instructions-artifact`, `review-artifact-verdict-mismatch`, `review-comment-count-mismatch`, `review-nitpick-only-mismatch`, or `hard-limit-exceeded`), retry the same review cycle with a different reviewer model up to `MAX_REVIEW_ARTIFACT_RETRIES` attempts. The dispatcher synthesizes an empty approve **only** when the reviewer reported `verdict="approve"` with `comment_count=0`; a `comment_count>0` status with a missing/invalid instructions file is NOT auto-approved (that would silently drop real review feedback) — it fails and retries. If using attempt-specific review artifact paths, regenerate the reviewer context so `RUN_WITH_IT_RESULT_FILE`, `REVIEWER_STATUS_FILE`, `REVIEWER_INSTRUCTIONS_FILE`, and the dispatcher `--result-file` all point at those same attempt-specific paths. If retries are exhausted, write `outcome="blocked"` with `blocking_reasons=["reviewer-missing-result-artifact"]`. A `hard-limit-exceeded` dispatcher result is infrastructure/artifact loss, not a product review verdict. Artifact infrastructure failures must not be reported as `failed-review`.
- After review approval (or a Step 0 review skip), acquire `.run-with-it/locks/merge.lock` and merge the issue branch into `RUN_FEATURE_BRANCH` **in a fresh throwaway worktree created from `origin/$RUN_FEATURE_BRANCH`** as specified in `sub-coordinator-prompt.md` Appendix C2. Never `git checkout`/`git merge` the shared feature branch in the shared root checkout — a conflict there poisons the shared checkout for every later issue. On conflict, capture the conflict files then `git merge --abort` inside the throwaway worktree and remove it. Emit `STATUS|type=merge-complete` on success or `STATUS|type=merge-failed` and write `outcome=merge_failed` on failure.
- **Every STATUS line read from a worker agent MUST also be written to `$SUB_COORD_LOG_FILE` immediately.** Use `echo "<line>" >> "$SUB_COORD_LOG_FILE"` (bash) or `Add-Content` (PowerShell) — do not rely on console output.
- The platform dispatcher and runner own `$RUN_WITH_IT_EVENTS_LOG`: they already append every dispatcher/runner STATUS line (`dispatch-*`, `agent-*`, `worker-*`) to it directly. Do NOT re-append those forwarded lines to `$RUN_WITH_IT_EVENTS_LOG` — that double-logs the run-wide event stream. Update `$RUN_WITH_IT_STATUS_FILE` (current.txt) for live status, and append to `$RUN_WITH_IT_EVENTS_LOG` only STATUS lines you emit yourself that the dispatcher does not (e.g. `merge-start`/`merge-complete`/`merge-failed` and sub-coordinator lifecycle lines).
- Do not accumulate progress lines in variables or memory.
- The default output thresholds are `WORKER_QUIET_SECONDS=120` and `WORKER_STALL_SECONDS=300` (the value the dispatch snippets pass explicitly; env fallback when no flag is passed: 600 on Bash, 300 on PowerShell); wrapper heartbeat defaults to 30 seconds and the hard limit to 7200 seconds for complexity/impl/modify/review roles (unbounded for other roles unless explicitly set). Preserved but unverified work always enters typed artifact recovery and never normal success.

## Result Processing Rules

- After the final worker-agent (implementer or modifier) completes, read its output report.
- Validate all required fields are present. Treat missing commits after a valid worker result (unless the result is a verified no-op — `no_op: true` with passing verification, which is success), failed verification, reviewer `reject`, or valid `revise` verdict cycle-cap exhaustion as `failed-review`. Treat missing/malformed artifacts caused by worker handoff infrastructure as role-specific retry candidates first, then as Artifact Recovery Worker candidates, and as `blocked` only after artifact recovery declines or fails with a recovery handoff.
- Apply the **Out-of-Scope Gate Rule** before any `failed-verification` verdict. A repo-global gate (aggregate coverage, whole-solution lint, full-suite thresholds) that fails only on units outside the issue's `ownership_scope`, while every scoped verification command passed, is not this issue's failure: report `outcome="blocked"` with `blocking_reasons=["out-of-scope-gate-failure"]` plus a `gate_failure` object naming the command and the out-of-scope units, and emit `STATUS|type=gate-attribution`. Fail closed — attribute to this issue whenever the failing units are unclear or any of them fall inside scope. Reporting each slice of a shared gate as `failed-review` terminates every slice and strands their dependents even though the scoped work was sound.
- Do NOT post GitHub comments. Do NOT close the GitHub issue. Those are the Main Orchestrator's responsibility.
- Include `model_usage` in the compact report. Normal Sub-Coordinators report only routed task roles `complexity`, `plan` (when the plan phase ran), `impl`, `review`, and `modify`; Merge Recovery Coordinator reports may contain `merge-recovery`. Add one entry per routed role with `role`, `cycle`, `agent`, `model`, and `selection_reason`. Do not read raw logs to reconstruct this; use the route decisions already selected and persisted in Sub-Coordinator state.
- Write the compact report JSON to `$SUB_COORD_REPORT_FILE`. This is your only output artifact.
- Clear all in-memory state after writing the report.

## Sandbox Rules

- If the platform dispatcher or runner (`run-with-it-dispatch.sh` / `run-with-it-dispatch.ps1` / `run-agent.sh` / `run-agent.ps1`) fails due to sandbox restrictions, use the current tool's explicit approved permission-escalation flow when available, then retry the same invocation before counting it as a failure.
- Sandbox failures do not consume the fallback budget. Only failures after an approved retry, or failures where permission escalation is unavailable, count.

## Resume Rules

- On context compression, re-read `$RUN_WITH_IT_ISSUE_DIR/sub-state.json` to restore which phase you were in (complexity, routing, plan, impl, review, modify).
- If an in-flight worker-agent has a result file, read the result and continue from the next phase.
- If an in-flight worker-agent has no result file, re-spawn it from the beginning of that phase.
- Never re-run a phase that already has a valid result file.
- If the report file `$SUB_COORD_REPORT_FILE` already exists and is valid, you are done — do not re-run any phase.
- In recovery mode (`SUB_COORD_RECOVERY_MODE=1`), read `$SUB_COORD_STATE_FILE` before creating or modifying any worker artifacts. Process completed worker artifacts first, then continue from the saved phase. Do not create a new issue worktree or overwrite the saved issue branch/worktree paths when they are present and valid.
