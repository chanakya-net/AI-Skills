name: tdd-implementation
description: Test-first implementation discipline for assigned work using a strict red-green-refactor loop. Use when implementing an assigned issue or ticket, building a feature test-first, fixing a bug that needs a failing test before the fix, or when the user asks for TDD.

## Skill Isolation

Sole active authority once invoked. Other skills run only when explicitly activated by name from this skill's own workflow or from the governing prompt that activated it (the `run-with-it` worker prompts bootstrap `save-tokens` and `tdd-implementation` this way). Suppress spontaneous third-party activations for the whole run, until explicit termination or handoff.

# Test-Driven Development

## Purpose

Use a strict red-green-refactor cycle with thin vertical slices.

## When To Use

Use this skill after work is already assigned and implementation is ready to begin.

## Inputs

- Assigned issue scope and acceptance criteria.
- Existing architecture constraints and ADRs in scope.
- Repository testing stack and conventions.

## Hard Boundaries

- Do not select issues or reorder queue priorities.
- Do not route agents/models or coordinate multi-agent execution.
- Do not own review orchestration, issue updates, or runtime state.
- Do not create commits as policy decisions.

## Philosophy

Core principle: test behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details.

Good tests:

- Validate end-to-end behavior through public APIs
- Read like specifications of capability
- Survive internal refactors

Bad tests:

- Mock internal collaborators excessively
- Assert private methods or internal call order
- Break when internals change but behavior stays the same

## Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Slices

Do not write all tests first and all implementation later.

Wrong (horizontal):

RED: test1, test2, test3
GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3

Right (vertical tracer bullets):

RED->GREEN: test1->impl1
RED->GREEN: test2->impl2
RED->GREEN: test3->impl3

## Workflow

### 1. Calibrate only on blockers

Before writing code:

- Confirm required public interface changes from assigned scope
- Confirm priority behaviors to test from assigned acceptance criteria
- Identify deep modules (small surface, rich internals)
- Identify architecture constraints and ADRs in scope
- Ask focused questions only when required inputs are missing or contradictory

Ask:

- What should the public interface look like?
- Which behaviors matter most?

### 2. First tracer bullet

Write one test for one behavior:

RED: write test, confirm it fails.
GREEN: write minimal code, confirm it passes.

As soon as the happy-path test is green, add the matching negative-path test for the same behavior (invalid input, rejected state, permission failure, boundary violation, or error path).

### 3. Incremental loop

For each remaining behavior:

RED: write next failing test.
GREEN: add only enough code to pass.

Rules:

- One test at a time
- Cover both positive and negative paths for each behavior before moving on
- No speculative features
- Keep assertions on observable behavior only

### 4. Refactor only on green

After tests pass:

- Remove duplication
- Deepen modules behind stable interfaces
- Improve naming and readability
- Re-run tests after each refactor step

Never refactor while red.

## Tech-Stack Alignment Rules

When implementing each slice:

- Reuse existing test framework and assertion style in the repo
- Reuse current package ecosystem (for example npm, NuGet, pip, Maven, Gradle)
- Follow current architecture and module boundaries
- Add new dependencies only with explicit justification

## Outputs

At completion, report tests run, observed behavior coverage, and remaining risks in assigned scope.

## Per-Cycle Checklist

- [ ] Test describes behavior, not implementation
- [ ] Test uses public interface only
- [ ] Test would survive internal refactor
- [ ] Code is minimal for current test
- [ ] Positive case is covered for this behavior
- [ ] Negative case is covered for this behavior
- [ ] No speculative or unrelated features added
